<h1> Dillon Loftiss</h1>
<h2> My major is Computer Applications, I plan on getting a Master's degree in Criminal Justice. I want to work to combat human trafficking.</h2>
</body>

<p> My goals are to graduate with my Bachelor's degree, then get my Master's degree, and ultimately find a job that helps combat human trafficking. These goals are all long-term goals,
    but with hard work and dedication I believe I can achieve them. A short-term goal at the moment is gaining as much knowledge and understanding in this class as I can. For myself this
    class seems to be overwhelming when I am looking at the assignment, specifically this one, but once I begin working and taking it one step at a time I feel relief. I feel more confident in my abilities.</p> 

    <p> My goals for my career are to work in what I am passionate about, I am passionate about helping others that are living in suffering. I do missionary work and have been to Uganda, Africa.
        My wife and I just got back from a trip at the end of June and we are going back to Uganda this October. I am very passionate about these trips, though it doesn't deal directly with human trafficking,
        many of the widows and children we meet with have been affected by it. Whether I ultimately work here in the states for a human trafficking organization or devote full-time to missionary work,
         I will be happy in the end getting to be in a career that I am passionate about. <p>
