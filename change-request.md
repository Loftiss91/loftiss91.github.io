# The Mini Change Request

### Requested by: Dr. Greg Gamel

## Proposed Change
<p>Add an interactive weather map from the Windy.com service to the webpage. I must do the following to implement the change :

- Navigate to the *Windy* website.
- Allow the website to use my location.
- Copy the embed HTML code and paste it into my index.html file.

## Reasons for the Change
<p> Dr. Gamel said, "I want to be able to see and interact with the weather map on your webpage, I don't want to click a link and visit another website."

## How This Change Will Add Value
<p> The *Windy* API allows customization for individuals looking to use web or mobile applications. This provides users and developers many possiblities. 

## How This Change Will Affect the Constraints
### Time
<p> I don't expect a delay or a need to change the project deadline. This is a simple request and will be implemented immediately.

### Quality
<p> The quality of this feature will be similar to visiting the actual website itself. It will provide users with a similar experience visually.

### Budget
<p> I don't expect any additional resources; this is a free feature provided from their website.
